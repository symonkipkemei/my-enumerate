<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">Custom Enumerate</h1>

## brief
Recreate a similar function as the enumerate function


## Task:
    ```
     This project will train you in your understanding of data types, writing functions, and reading documentation.

     Your task is to create a function called my_enumerate() that mirrors the functionality of Python's built-in enumerate().

     Don't just copy the range(len(sequence)) example and work off of it. Instead, go online, train your search engine skills, and research how enumerate() works internally. Then use this to inform your design decisions for your custom my_enumerate() function.

     Ultimately, you should be able to use my_enumerate() as a drop-in replacement for enumerate() that can be used in the same way, and will produce the same results:
